Our goal: Rebuild the entire web application from the ground up without interrupting our customer's experience, and adding new, compelling features when we could. In my four years there I have:\r\n\r\n* Tackled an entire web site redesign and revamp while helping to launch our internationalization campaigns, all while improving our YSLOW and PAGESPEED scores.\r\n\r\nWe went from [this](http://i.imgur.com/Yz5xnGh.png):\r\n![Old Design](http://i.imgur.com/Yz5xnGh.png)\r\n\r\nTo [this](http://i.imgur.com/YKe8CEt.png) in under a three weeks with only two engineers:\r\n![New Design](http://i.imgur.com/YKe8CEt.png)\r\n\r\n* With our new team, helped lead the charge into building out our new Python based WebApps and APIs based on an Service Oriented Architecture.\r\n* Designed and implemented an entire PCI compliant billing system.\r\n* Built and maintained a page design system that allowed creation and testing of pricing pages on SM.com\r\n* Designed and implemented our baseline libraries and asset system for scalable deployment including javascript libraries, Jinja/HTML/CSS templates, Python SDKs, and REST APIs.\r\n* Took over as Tech lead heading up our efforts to centralize system architecture with a growing ecosystem.\r\n* Managed the migration of libraries, projects, and code bases that previously belonged to me to their new respective teams and provided supported when possible.\r\n* Lead SurveyMonkey's new Enterprise product, designing the database implications through engineering the full stack with a team of 5 full-time players, delivering more features for MVP and before schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nI recently have built and have been leading our Enterprise product and Asset Sharing (Library) initiative.\r\n\r\nA quick video preview of the results below:  \r\n[Enterprise Management](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qvbuv6of0ztyici/enterpriseproduct.mov?dl=0)  \r\n[Library Management - Managing Assets](https://www.dropbox.com/s/smozqh6575m9gpe/library_table.mov?dl=0)  \r\n[Library - Adding Assets](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w55v21blfrn5eav/library.mov?dl=0)  \r\n\r\n**WHERE AM I GOING**\r\n-----\r\nCurrently I am looking for the next engaging opportunity that will utilize my ability to work across the stack, design nimble, and scalable systems, whilst creating a baseline which others can build off of. I love being challenged, whether that's building a full-stack solution or tackling learning how to code in C# and build an iOS application.\r\n\r\nThey say these days that it's the work that keeps you at the company because it's engaging, in my experience it's the people. My next challenge should include working with a team who is excited about the project they are building, and in turn, helps me stay excited about it. I'd hope that it makes a difference in someone's world, whether that be making something easier to use for consumers, businesses, or life in general.\r\n\r\n**HONING THE KNIFE**\r\n----\r\nWhen I find a few free hours, or a rainy day where I am trapped inside (being from California, I don't like wasting my sunny days), I look at Open Source projects and contribute where I can. At times, I pick a project to learn something new and tackle an area I haven't touched in a while, or had to opportunity to approach in my day job. An example would be working directly with node and webkit. I pulled down the source, started reading through it, and attempted to write features to see how quickly I could engage in the project. Not all of these were successes in terms of contributing, but helped me further understand where the future could lie in the underlying technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n**WORK EXPERIENCE**\r\n----\r\n\r\nSurvey Monkey\r\n    Senior/Principal Software Engineer  Feb 2010 — present\r\n\r\nYahoo!\r\n    Senior Software Engineer    Mar 2008 — Feb 2010\r\n\r\nYahoo!\r\n    Solutions Engineer  Aug 2007 — Mar 2008\r\n\r\nAT&T\r\n    Sr. Analyst Jun 2006 — Jul 2007\r\n\r\nPrivate Contracting \r\n    Owner and founder Jan 1996 — Jan 2001\r\n\r\n**EDUCATION**\r\n----\r\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz \r\n    BS, Information Systems & Tech Management  2006","google":"UA-58572028-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
