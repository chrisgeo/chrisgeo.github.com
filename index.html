</h2>

<p>When I started at my current company, SurveyMonkey, I was brought on to a brand-new and quickly expanding engineering team. Our goal: Rebuild the entire web application from the ground up without interrupting our customer's experience, and adding new, compelling features when we could. In my four years there I have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tackled an entire web site redesign and revamp while helping to launch our internationalization campaigns, all while improving our YSLOW and PAGESPEED scores.</li>
</ul>

<p>We went from <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Yz5xnGh.png">this</a>:

<p>To <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YKe8CEt.png">this</a> in under a three weeks with only two engineers:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YKe8CEt.png" alt="New Design"></p>

<ul>
<li>With our new team, helped lead the charge into building out our new Python based WebApps and APIs based on an Service Oriented Architecture.</li>
<li>Designed and implemented an entire PCI compliant billing system.</li>
<li>Built and maintained a page design system that allowed creation and testing of pricing pages on SM.com</li>
<li>Designed and implemented our baseline libraries and asset system for scalable deployment including javascript libraries, Jinja/HTML/CSS templates, Python SDKs, and REST APIs.</li>
<li>Took over as Tech lead heading up our efforts to centralize system architecture with a growing ecosystem.</li>
<li>Managed the migration of libraries, projects, and code bases that previously belonged to me to their new respective teams and provided supported when possible.</li>
<li>Lead SurveyMonkey's new Enterprise product, designing the database implications through engineering the full stack with a team of 5 full-time players, delivering more features for MVP and before schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p>I recently have built and have been leading our Enterprise product and Asset Sharing (Library) initiative.</p>

</h2>

<p>Currently I am looking for the next engaging opportunity that will utilize my ability to work across the stack, design nimble, and scalable systems, whilst creating a baseline which others can build off of. I love being challenged, whether that's building a full-stack solution or tackling learning how to code in C# and build an iOS application.</p>

<p>They say these days that it's the work that keeps you at the company because it's engaging, in my experience it's the people. My next challenge should include working with a team who is excited about the project they are building, and in turn, helps me stay excited about it. I'd hope that it makes a difference in someone's world, whether that be making something easier to use for consumers, businesses, or life in general.</p>

</h2>

<p>When I find a few free hours, or a rainy day where I am trapped inside (being from California, I don't like wasting my sunny days), I look at Open Source projects and contribute where I can. At times, I pick a project to learn something new and tackle an area I haven't touched in a while, or had to opportunity to approach in my day job. An example would be working directly with node and webkit. I pulled down the source, started reading through it, and attempted to write features to see how quickly I could engage in the project. Not all of these were successes in terms of contributing, but helped me further understand where the future could lie in the underlying technologies.</p>
